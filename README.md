# ThursdaySpeakloop
ThursdaySpeakloop is an intelligent, voice-enabled assistant designed to streamline Thursday team update calls. It integrates with Notion to fetch team and teammate data, randomly selects team members, and audibly announces their names and team detailsâ€”mimicking the traditional manual process but with automation, clarity, and consistency.
